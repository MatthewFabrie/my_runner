# my_runner
This project was my second graphical project. The goal of the project was to make an endless runner game where the player moves from one side of the screen to the other. If you hit an obstacle you lose and if you make it to the end of the level you win. For this project we had to overcome a couple of challenges like learning how to manage collisions and how to manage custom maps in order to implement them into the game. In order to launch the game you must clone the repository, then you must execute the "make" command at the root of the project in a terminal and then you can launch the game by executing "./my_runner level1.txt" with level1.txt being any map you want, you can even create your own maps and play them in the game.
